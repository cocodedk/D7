## OG Image

The `og-image.svg` file serves as a placeholder for Open Graph social sharing. For better results, you may want to replace this with a proper PNG image (1200x630px) that includes:

- D7 branding
- Card game theme
- Danish/Persian cultural elements
- Professional design suitable for social media previews

To convert the SVG to PNG or create a new image, you can use tools like:
- Figma
- Canva
- ImageMagick: `convert og-image.svg og-image.png -resize 1200x630`
