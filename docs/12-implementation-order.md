# Implementation Order

## Phase 1: Foundation
1. Project setup (React + Node.js + Netlify)
2. Database schema and migrations

11. Image handling (avatar, game photos)
12. Error handling and validation

## Phase 4: Deployment
13. Netlify configuration
14. Environment setup
15. Testing and bug fixes
16. Production deployment

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests: Scoring engine first
- Integration tests: API endpoints
- E2E tests: Critical paths (game recording)
- Manual testing: Mobile devices

## Key Milestones

- ✅ Scoring engine works correctly
- ✅ Game recording flow complete
- ✅ Tournament lifecycle enforced
- ✅ Mobile UI polished
